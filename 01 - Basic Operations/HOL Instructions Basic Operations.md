6. Replace the code of CsomController with snippet 2
7. Run the code - CTRL-F5, click the button and check that list was created

PnP example
-----------
1. Get SharePointPnPCoreOnline via NuGet (name change, not OfficeDevPnP anymore, make sure to choose packages from Nuget – not Microsoft and .NET)
2. Replace code for Index view of the Home controller (Views/Home/Index.cshtml - snippet 3)
4. Right click on Controllers folder, Add, Controller..., MVC5 Controller - Empty, name it 'PnPController'
5. Replace the code of PnPController with snippet 4
6. Change the URL in PnPController for your SharePoint Online site

Note on authencation methods
----------------------------
1. Set host filter in Fiddler: SharePoint online URL;localhost:44347
2. Go to https://localhost:44347/Csom/CreateList?SPHostUrl=[your SharePoint Online site URL]
3. Point-out: 1. SharePoint context filter requires query string parameters, 2. SharePoint context filter does redirect when needed (and removes custom query string parameters)
